# Solution-approach_1
approach for lean manufacturing
-- Data Collection & Integration sources: IoT sensors, SCADA systems, ERP, MES, and manual logs.
. Data Captured: Machine runtime, OEE metrics, maintenance history, failure logs, and financial impact.
.  Integration: Use Power BI, SQL, or a cloud data warehouse for a centralized view.

--Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
. Handle missing values (e.g., impute missing downtime records).
. Standardize timestamp formats for accurate time-series analysis.
. Remove duplicate or erroneous logs.

-- Root Cause Analysis (Descriptive Analytics)
. OEE Analysis – Identify trends in availability, performance, and quality.
. Downtime Pattern Analysis – When and why downtime occurs most frequently.
. Pareto Analysis (80/20 Rule) – Find the top causes contributing to most downtime.

-- Predictive Maintenance (Machine Learning)
Model Selection:
. Time Series Forecasting (ARIMA, LSTM) – Predict future machine failures.
. Classification Models (Random Forest, XGBoost) – Predict whether a machine will fail based on past behavior.

-- Automation & Proactive Maintenance
. Set up automated alerts (email/SMS) when downtime risk is high.
. Implement real-time dashboards in Power BI to track machine health.
